# NEAR Protocol Experiments

Code samples and demos done while learning the NEAR protocol written in Typescript.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and update the values so the script can get your `testnet` account keys.

There are several ways to get the account keys but the most straightforward is using the NEAR CLI [(docs)](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli#access-key-location) then setting `.env` to use your-local stored keys.

## Run

Get account balance:

```bash
npm start
```
